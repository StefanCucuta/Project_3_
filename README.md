**BATTLESHIP GAME**

***GAME RULES***

Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

## Design <a name='design'></a>

- **Colour Scheme**

    *Not required for this project.*

- **Typography**

    *I chose to capitalize all text on the project to create consistency in size throughout.*

- **Imagery**

    *Special attention to the board display during game play was required to ensure for suitable contrast between the different markers. [The Ascii Code](https://theasciicode.com.ar/) website was used to explore my options regarding ASCII characters and boat image for the beagining of the game.*

## Development <a name='development'></a>

*Initial development was to create a flow diagram using [LucidChart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/) so i could begin exploring how the requirements for my game and their dependencies would work together.

*For each valid turn, game end conditions must be checked and if reached, the turn sequence must be broken out of and the game end logic run.
